This project is build on reveal.js which is an open source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create fully featured and beautiful presentations for free. [Check out the live demo](https://revealjs.com/).

The project is to do Indian Premier League (IPL) data analysis using D3.js library. I have used reveal.js to give it a presentation look but all the slide components are built ussing HTML, CSS and D3.js. 

This framework comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://revealjs.com/vertical-slides/), [Markdown support](https://revealjs.com/markd own/), [Auto-Animate](https://revealjs.com/auto-animate/), [PDF export](https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/), [speaker notes](https://revealjs.com/speaker-view/), [LaTeX support](https://revealjs.com/math/), [syntax highlighted code](https://revealjs.com/code/) and much more but I have not used much in this project and kept things simple.
